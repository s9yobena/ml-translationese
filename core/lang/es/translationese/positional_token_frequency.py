"""\
Writers have a relatively limited vocabulary from which to choose words to open
or close a sentence. We hypothesize that the choices subject to interference.
The value of this feature is the normalized frequency of tokens appearing in
the first, second, antepenultimate, penultimate and last positions in a
sentence. We exclude sentences shorter than five tokens.  Punctuation marks are
considered as tokens in this feature, and for this reason the three last
positions of a sentence are considered, while only the first two of them are
interesting for our purposes.
