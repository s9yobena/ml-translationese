"""\
This feature is a variant of POS n-grams, where the n-grams can be anchored by
specific (function) words. This feature is defined as the (normalized)
frequency of trigrams of function words in the chunk. In addition, we count
also trigrams consisting of two function words (from the same list) and one
other word; in such cases, we replace the other word by its POS. In sum, we
compute the frequencies in the chunk of triplets ``<w1, w2, w3>``, where at
least two of the elements are functions words, and at most one is a POS tag.
